This is something that the R community has been pretty good about encouraging and thanks to guides like this newcomers are able to get some help on putting together these examples. People who are able to read these guides and come back with reproducible data will often have much better luck getting answers to their questions.How can we create good reproducible examples for pandas questions? Simple dataframes can be put together e.g.:import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'user': ['Bob' 'Jane' 'Alice']                    'income': [40000 50000 42000]})But many example datasets need more complicated structure e.g.:datetime indices or dataMultiple categorical variables (is there an equivalent to R's expand.grid() function which produces all possible combinations of some given variables?)MultiIndex or Panel dataFor datasets that are hard to mock up using a few lines of code is there an equivalent to R's dput() that allows you to generate copy-pasteable code to regenerate your datastructure?","[<code>pandas</code><code>pandas</code><code>importpandasaspddf=pd.DataFrame({'user':['Bob''Jane''Alice']'income':[400005000042000]})</code><code>datetime</code><code>expand.grid()</code><code>dput()</code>]"

The result is instead very different and very astonishing (for a novice):>>> foo()[5]>>> foo()[5 5]>>> foo()[5 5 5]>>> foo()[5 5 5 5]>>> foo()A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature and called it a dramatic design flaw of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C without breeding bugs?)Edit:Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular I elaborated further:>>> def a():...     print(a executed)...     return []... >>>            >>> def b(x=a()):...     x.append(5)...     print(x)... a executed>>> b()[5]>>> b()[5 5]To me it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or together with it?Doing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called not defined something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be hybrid in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed meaning at function definition.","[<code>deffoo(a=[]):a.append(5)returna</code><code>[5]</code><code>foo()[5]foo()[55]foo()[555]foo()[5555]foo()</code><code>defa():...print(aexecuted)...return[]...defb(x=a()):...x.append(5)...print(x)...aexecutedb()[5]b()[55]</code><code>x</code><code>def</code>]"

There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.The above response looks promising but it's all hieroglyphs to me.

This seems like a substantial change but it's only a short paragraph in the documentation. It is described as a CPython implementation detail rather than a language feature but also implies this may become standard in the future.How does the new dictionary implementation perform better than the older one while preserving element order?Here is the text from the documentation:dict() now uses a “compact” representation pioneered by PyPy. The memory usage of the new dict() is between 20% and 25% smaller compared to Python 3.5. PEP 468 (Preserving the order of **kwargs in a function.) is implemented by this. The order-preserving aspect of this new implementation is considered an implementation detail and should not be relied upon (this may change in the future but it is desired to have this new dict implementation in the language for a few releases before changing the language spec to mandate order-preserving semantics for all current and future Python implementations; this also helps preserve backwards-compatibility with older versions of the language where random iteration order is still in effect e.g. Python 3.5).

Consider the following code:adders=[None None None None]for i in [0123]:   adders[i]=lambda a: i+aprint adders[1](3)It builds a simple array of functions that take a single input and return that input added by a number. The functions are constructed in for loop where the iterator i runs from 0 to 3. For each of these numbers a lambda function is created which captures i and adds it to the function's input. The last line calls the second lambda function with 3 as a parameter. To my surprise the output was 6.I expected a 4. My reasoning was: in Python everything is an object and thus every variable is essential a pointer to it. When creating the lambda closures for i I expected it to store a pointer to the integer object currently pointed to by i. That means that when i assigned a new integer object it shouldn't effect the previously created closures. Sadly inspecting the adders array within a debugger shows that it does. All lambda functions refer to the last value of i 3 which results in adders[1](3) returning 6.Which make me wonder about the following:What do the closures capture exactly?What is the most elegant way to convince the lambda functions to capture the current value of i in a way that will not be affected when i changes its value?","[<code>adders=[NoneNoneNoneNone]foriin[0123]:adders[i]=lambdaa:i+aprintadders[1](3)</code><code>for</code><code>i</code><code>0</code><code>3</code><code>lambda</code><code>i</code><code>lambda</code><code>3</code><code>6</code><code>4</code><code>lambda</code><code>i</code><code>i</code><code>i</code><code>adders</code><code>lambda</code><code>i</code><code>3</code><code>adders[1](3)</code><code>6</code><code>lambda</code><code>i</code><code>i</code>]"

But this evidence suggests otherwise.The site uploads a fingerprint to their servers but I checked and the fingerprint of Selenium is identical to the fingerprint when using Chrome.This is one of the fingerprint payloads that they send to their servers:{appName:Netscapeplatform:Linuxx86_64cookies:1syslang:en-USuserlang:en-UScpu:productSub:20030107setTimeout:1setInterval:1plugins:{0:ChromePDFViewer1:ShockwaveFlash2:WidevineContentDecryptionModule3:NativeClient4:ChromePDFViewer}mimeTypes:{0:application/pdf1:ShockwaveFlashapplication/x-shockwave-flash2:FutureSplashPlayerapplication/futuresplash3:WidevineContentDecryptionModuleapplication/x-ppapi-widevine-cdm4:NativeClientExecutableapplication/x-nacl5:PortableNativeClientExecutableapplication/x-pnacl6:PortableDocumentFormatapplication/x-google-chrome-pdf}screen:{width:1600height:900colorDepth:24}fonts:{0:monospace1:DejaVuSerif2:Georgia3:DejaVuSans4:TrebuchetMS5:Verdana6:AndaleMono7:DejaVuSansMono8:LiberationMono9:NimbusMonoL10:CourierNew11:Courier}}It's identical in Selenium and in Chrome.VPNs work for a single use but they get detected after I load the first page.

How should I plan before start writing a python program?I know there is no such thing as best practice in programming and I am not asking for it either. I just want some advice and explanations to keep me on the right direction as I am learning Python by myself.","[<code>deffunA():deffunA1():deffunA12():#stuffdeffunA2():#stuffdeffunB():deffunB1():#stuffdeffunB2():#stuffdeffunC():deffunC1():#stuffdeffunC2():#stuffroot=tk.Tk()button1=tk.Button(rootcommand=funA)button1.pack()button2=tk.Button(rootcommand=funB)button2.pack()button3=tk.Button(rootcommand=funC)button3.pack()</code><code>funA</code><code>funB</code><code>funC</code><code>Toplevel</code>]"

In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.Best methods:Method 1: A decoratordef singleton(class_):    instances = {}    def getinstance(*args **kwargs):        if class_ not in instances:            instances[class_] = class_(*args **kwargs)        return instances[class_]    return getinstance@singletonclass MyClass(BaseClass):    passProsDecorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.ConsWhile objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects MyClass itself is a function not a class so you cannot call class methods from it.

Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...What is the point of the _sealed attributeCan't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse.

I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about big data that requires a distributed network but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.My first thought is to use HDFStore to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:Loading flat files into a permanent on-disk database structureQuerying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structureUpdating the database after manipulating pieces in pandasReal-world examples would be much appreciated especially from anyone who uses pandas on large data.Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.In order to use Pandas I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records bankruptcies etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1000 to 2000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows but I do perform many operations that create new columns.Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new compound column. For example if var1 > 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.Finally I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2 exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting intuitive relationships to model.A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business say Retail credit cards.  To do this I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns however I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.The modeling process requires that I analyze every column look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created I then move on to another group of columns say college education and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).","[<code>HDFStore</code><code>ifvar12thennewvar='A'elifvar2=4thennewvar='B'</code>]"

What if you want to return four or five values? Sure you could keep tupling them but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.Option: Using a dictionaryThe next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python the obvious way to do this is by means of a dict.Consider the following:def g(x):  y0 = x + 1  y1 = x * 3  y2 = y0 ** y3  return {'y0': y0 'y1': y1 'y2': y2}(Just to be clear y0 y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)Now we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For exampleresult['y0']Option: Using a classHowever there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:class ReturnValue:  def __init__(self y0 y1 y2):     self.y0 = y0     self.y1 = y1     self.y2 = y2def g(x):  y0 = x + 1  y1 = x * 3  y2 = y0 ** y3  return ReturnValue(y0 y1 y2)In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all { y0 y1 y2 } just end up being entries in the internal __dict__ of the ReturnValue.There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as:class ReturnValue(object):  __slots__ = [y0 y1 y2]  def __init__(self y0 y1 y2):     self.y0 = y0     self.y1 = y1     self.y2 = y2From the Python Reference Manual:The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance.Option: Using a dataclass (Python 3.7+)Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses return a class with automatically added special methods typing and other useful tools:@dataclassclass Returnvalue:    y0: int    y1: float    y3: intdef total_cost(x):    y0 = x + 1    y1 = x * 3    y2 = y0 ** y3    return ReturnValue(y0 y1 y2)Option: Using a listAnother suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:def h(x):  result = [x + 1]  result.append(x * 3)  result.append(y0 ** y3)  return resultThis is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type but it conceivably could be.A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are mutable whereas tuples are not.I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.QuestionAfter the lengthy preamble comes the inevitable question.

It's nothing fancy at all; its only purpose is to get the data off of a betting website and have this data put into Excel.Most of the issues are solvable and I'm having a good little mess around. However I'm hitting a massive hurdle over one issue. If a site loads a table of horses and lists current betting prices this information is not in any source file. The clue is that this data is live sometimes with the numbers being updated obviously from some remote server. The HTML on my PC simply has a hole where their servers are pushing through all the interesting data that I need.Now my experience with dynamic web content is low so this thing is something I'm having trouble getting my head around. I think Java or Javascript is a key this pops up often. The scraper is simply a odds comparison engine.  Some sites have APIs but I need this for those that don't. I'm using the scrapy library with Python 2.7I do apologize if this question is too open-ended. In short my question is: how can scrapy be used to scrape this dynamic data so that I can use it?  So that I can scrape this betting odds data in real-time?","[]"

Vectorized functions broadcast operations over the entire series or DataFrame to achieve speedups much greater than conventionally iterating over the data. However I am quite surprised to see a lot of code (including from answers on Stack Overflow) offering solutions to problems that involve looping through data using for loops and list comprehensions. The documentation and API say that loops are bad and that one should never iterate over arrays series or DataFrames. So how come I sometimes see users suggesting loop-based solutions?1 - While it is true that the question sounds somewhat broad the truth is that there are very specific situations when for loops are usually better than conventionally iterating over data.

While reading about classes it goes on to say that in Python there is no need to declare instance variables. You just use them in the constructor and boom they are there. So for example:class Simple:    def __init__(self s):        print(inside the simple constructor)        self.s = s    def show(self):        print(self.s)    def showMsg(self msg):        print(msg + ':' self.show())If that’s true then any object of class Simple can just change the value of variable s outside of the class. For example: if __name__ == __main__:    x = Simple(constructor argument)    x.s = test15 # this changes the value    x.show()    x.showMsg(A message)In Java we have been taught about public/private/protected variables.  Those keywords make sense because at times you want variables in a class to which no one outside the class has access to.

Moreover I have to create annoying nested iterators if I want to go over all the values. I could also use tuples as keys like such:{('new jersey' 'mercer county' 'plumbers'): 3 ('new jersey' 'mercer county' 'programmers'): 81 ('new jersey' 'middlesex county' 'programmers'): 81 ('new jersey' 'middlesex county' 'salesmen'): 62 ('new york' 'queens county' 'plumbers'): 9 ('new york' 'queens county' 'salesmen'): 36}This makes iterating over the values very simple and natural but it is more syntactically painful to do things like aggregations and looking at subsets of the dictionary (e.g. if I just want to go state-by-state).Basically sometimes I want to think of a nested dictionary as a flat dictionary and sometimes I want to think of it indeed as a complex hierarchy. I could wrap this all in a class but it seems like someone might have done this already. Alternatively it seems like there might be some really elegant syntactical constructions to do this. How could I do this better?Addendum: I'm aware of setdefault() but it doesn't really make for clean syntax.  Also each sub-dictionary you create still needs to have setdefault() manually set.","[<code>{'newjersey':{'mercercounty':{'plumbers':3'programmers':81}'middlesexcounty':{'programmers':81'salesmen':62}}'newyork':{'queenscounty':{'plumbers':9'salesmen':36}}}</code><code>{('newjersey''mercercounty''plumbers'):3('newjersey''mercercounty''programmers'):81('newjersey''middlesexcounty''programmers'):81('newjersey''middlesexcounty''salesmen'):62('newyork''queenscounty''plumbers'):9('newyork''queenscounty''salesmen'):36}</code><code>setdefault()</code><code>setdefault()</code>]"

I know the space of parameters is huge but this shouldn't be so slow.

And when a dict is similarly passed to a groupby DataFrame it expects the keys to be the column names that the function will be applied to.What I want to do is apply multiple functions to several columns (but certain columns will be operated on multiple times). Also some functions will depend on other columns in the groupby object (like sumif functions). My current solution is to go column by column and doing something like the code above using lambdas for functions that depend on other rows. But this is taking a long time (I think it takes a long time to iterate through a groupby object). I'll have to change it so that I iterate through the whole groupby object in a single run but I'm wondering if there's a built in way in pandas to do this somewhat cleanly.For example I've tried something likegrouped.agg({'C_sum' : lambda x: x['C'].sum()             'C_std': lambda x: x['C'].std()             'D_sum' : lambda x: x['D'].sum()}             'D_sumifC3': lambda x: x['D'][x['C'] == 3].sum() ...)but as expected I get a KeyError (since the keys have to be a column if agg is called from a DataFrame).Is there any built in way to do what I'd like to do or a possibility that this functionality may be added or will I just need to iterate through the groupby manually?","[<code>In[563]:grouped['D'].agg({'result1':np.sum.....:'result2':np.mean}).....:Out[563]:result2result1Abar-0.579846-1.739537foo-0.280588-1.402938</code><code>grouped.agg({'C_sum':lambdax:x['C'].sum()'C_std':lambdax:x['C'].std()'D_sum':lambdax:x['D'].sum()}'D_sumifC3':lambdax:x['D'][x['C']==3].sum()...)</code><code>agg</code>]"

My question is why the design decisions were made in this way. For example (no pun intended):for foo in xrange(10):    bar = 2print(foo bar)The above will print (92). This strikes me as weird: 'foo' is really just controlling the loop and 'bar' was defined inside the loop. I can understand why it might be necessary for 'bar' to be accessible outside the loop (otherwise for loops would have very limited functionality). What I don't understand is why it is necessary for the control variable to remain in scope after the loop exits. In my experience it simply clutters the global namespace and makes it harder to track down errors that would be caught by interpreters in other languages.","[<code>forfooinxrange(10):bar=2print(foobar)</code>]"

If the models are small enough that a single model does not take full advantage of all the computational units of the GPU this can actually result in a speedup compared with running one training process after the other. Even in cases where the concurrent access to the GPU does slow down the individual training time it is still nice to have the flexibility of having multiple users simultaneously train on the GPU.The problem with TensorFlow is that by default it allocates the full amount of available GPU memory when it is launched. Even for a small two-layer neural network I see that all 12 GB of the GPU memory is used up.Is there a way to make TensorFlow only allocate say 4 GB of GPU memory if one knows that this is enough for a given model?","[]"

It explains why I asked this question and also why I'd like to know why Python is different from the other languages:I come from languages that train you to think everything should be only as public as needed and no more. The reasoning is that this will reduce dependencies and make the code safer to alter. The Python way of doing things in reverse -- starting from public and going towards hidden -- is odd to me.","[]"

In contrast to variable declarations in statically typed languages the goal of annotation syntax is to provide an easy way to specify structured type metadata for third party tools and libraries via the abstract syntax tree and the __annotations__ attribute.So from what I read they are part of the type hints coming from Python 3.5 described in What are Type hints in Python 3.5.I follow the captain: str and class Starship example but not sure about the last one: How does primes: List[int] = [] explain?

(I'm not talking about safe_substitute which as I understand it offers unique capabilities)Similar questions and why I think they're not duplicates:Python string formatting: % vs. .format — treats only methods 1 and 2 and asks which one is better; my question is explicitly about deprecation in the light of the Zen of PythonString formatting options: pros and cons — treats only methods 1a and 1b in the question 1 and 2 in the answer and also nothing about deprecationadvanced string formatting vs template strings — mostly about methods 1 and 3 and doesn't address deprecationString formatting expressions (Python) — answer mentions that the original '%' approach is planned to be deprecated. But what's the difference between planned to be deprecated pending deprecation and actual deprecation?

My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.By modern Python I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by custom I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:>>> class MyError(Exception):...     def __init__(self message):...         self.message = message... >>> MyError(foo)_sandbox.py:3: DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named message. I gather from PEP-352 that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter args but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.Update: two answers have suggested overriding __init__ and __str__/__unicode__/__repr__.

In interactive mode I want all output to go to the screen as well as to a log file including output from any system calls.  In daemon mode all output goes to the log.  Daemon mode works great using os.dup2().  I can't find a way to tee all output to a log in interactive mode without modifying each and every system call.In other words I want the functionality of the command line 'tee' for any output generated by a python app including system call output.To clarify: To redirect all output I do something like this and it works great:# open our log fileso = se = open(%s.log % self.name 'w' 0)# re-open stdout without bufferingsys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno() 'w' 0)# redirect stdout and stderr to the log file opened aboveos.dup2(so.fileno() sys.stdout.fileno())os.dup2(se.fileno() sys.stderr.fileno())The nice thing about this is that it requires no special print calls from the rest of the code.  The code also runs some shell commands so it's nice not having to deal with each of their output individually as well.Simply I want to do the same except duplicating instead of redirecting.At first thought I thought that simply reversing the dup2's should work.  Why doesn't it?  Here's my test: import os sys### my broken solution:so = se = open(a.log 'w' 0)sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno() 'w' 0)os.dup2(sys.stdout.fileno() so.fileno())os.dup2(sys.stderr.fileno() se.fileno())###print(foo bar)os.spawnve(P_WAIT /bin/ls [/bin/ls] {})os.execve(/bin/ls [/bin/ls] os.environ)The file a.log should be identical to what was displayed on the screen.","[<code>os.dup2()</code><code>#openourlogfileso=se=open(%s.log%self.name'w'0)#re-openstdoutwithoutbufferingsys.stdout=os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno()'w'0)#redirectstdoutandstderrtothelogfileopenedaboveos.dup2(so.fileno()sys.stdout.fileno())os.dup2(se.fileno()sys.stderr.fileno())</code><code>dup2</code><code>importossys###mybrokensolution:so=se=open(a.log'w'0)sys.stdout=os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno()'w'0)os.dup2(sys.stdout.fileno()so.fileno())os.dup2(sys.stderr.fileno()se.fileno())###print(foobar)os.spawnve(P_WAIT/bin/ls[/bin/ls]{})os.execve(/bin/ls[/bin/ls]os.environ)</code>]"

With respect to the image below does this mean that we are considering the many to one case where the number of pink boxes are 3? Or does it literally mean the chain length is 3 (i.e. only 3 green boxes considered). Does the features argument become relevant when we consider multivariate series? e.g. modelling two financial stocks simultaneously?Stateful LSTMsDoes stateful LSTMs mean that we save the cell memory values between runs of batches? If this is the case batch_size is one and the memory is reset between the training runs so what was the point of saying that it was stateful. I'm guessing this is related to the fact that training data is not shuffled but I'm not sure how.Any thoughts?Image reference: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/Edit 1:A bit confused about @van's comment about the red and green boxes being equal. So just to confirm does the following API calls correspond to the unrolled diagrams? Especially noting the second diagram (batch_size was arbitrarily chosen.):Edit 2:For people who have done Udacity's deep learning course and still confused about the time_step argument look at the following discussion: https://discussions.udacity.com/t/rnn-lstm-use-implementation/163169Update:It turns out model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(vocab_len))) was what I was looking for.

I'll do my best to describe the error why I run into it and why I'm tying this particular approach to solve my problem (which I will describe in a second):Let's suppose I have a module in which I've defined some utility functions/classes which refer to entities defined in the namespace into which this auxiliary module will be imported (let a be such an entity):module1:def f():    print aAnd then I have the main program where a is defined into which I want to import those utilities:import module1a=3module1.f()Executing the program will trigger the following error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File Z:\Python\main.py line 10 in <module>    module1.f()  File Z:\Python\module1.py line 3 in f    print aNameError: global name 'a' is not definedSimilar questions have been asked in the past (two days ago d'uh) and several solutions have been suggested however I don't really think these fit my requirements. Here's my particular context:I'm trying to make a Python program which connects to a MySQL database server and displays/modifies data with a GUI. For cleanliness sake I've defined the bunch of auxiliary/utility MySQL-related functions in a separate file. However they all have a common variable which I had originally defined inside the utilities module and which is the cursor object from MySQLdb module.I later realised that the cursor object (which is used to communicate with the db server) should be defined in the main module so that both the main module and anything that is imported into it can access that object.End result would be something like this:utilities_module.py:def utility_1(args):    code which references a variable named curdef utility_n(args):    etceteraAnd my main module:program.py:import MySQLdb Tkinterdb=MySQLdb.connect(#blahblah) ; cur=db.cursor()  #cur is defined!from utilities_module import *And then as soon as I try to call any of the utilities functions it triggers the aforementioned global name not defined error.A particular suggestion was to have a from program import cur statement in the utilities file such as this:utilities_module.py:from program import cur#rest of function definitionsprogram.py:import Tkinter MySQLdbdb=MySQLdb.connect(#blahblah) ; cur=db.cursor()  #cur is defined!from utilities_module import *But that's cyclic import or something like that and bottom line it crashes too. So my question is:How in hell can I make the cur object defined in the main module visible to those auxiliary functions which are imported into it?Thanks for your time and my deepest apologies if the solution has been posted elsewhere. I just can't find the answer myself and I've got no more tricks in my book.","[<code>deff():printa</code><code>importmodule1a=3module1.f()</code><code>Traceback(mostrecentcalllast):FileZ:\Python\main.pyline10in&ltmodulemodule1.f()FileZ:\Python\module1.pyline3infprintaNameError:globalname'a'isnotdefined</code><code>defutility_1(args):codewhichreferencesavariablenamedcurdefutility_n(args):etcetera</code><code>importMySQLdbTkinterdb=MySQLdb.connect(#blahblah)cur=db.cursor()#curisdefined!fromutilities_moduleimport*</code><code>fromprogramimportcur#restoffunctiondefinitions</code><code>importTkinterMySQLdbdb=MySQLdb.connect(#blahblah)cur=db.cursor()#curisdefined!fromutilities_moduleimport*</code>]"

For example if I haveprices = [5 12 45]I wantprice1 = 5price2 = 12price3 = 45Can I do this in a loop or something instead of manually assigning price1 = prices[0] price2 = prices[1] etc.Thank you. EDITMany people suggested that I write a reason for requiring this. First there have been times where I have thought this may be more convenient than using a list...I don't remember exactly when but I think I have thought of using this when there are many levels of nesting. For example if one has a list of lists of lists defining variables in the above way may help reduce the level of nesting. Second today I thought of this when trying to learn use of Pytables. I just came across Pytables and I saw that when defining the structure of a table the column names and types are described in the following manner:class TableFormat(tables.IsDescription):    firstColumnName = StringCol(16)    secondColumnName = StringCol(16)    thirdColumnName = StringCol(16)If I have 100 columns typing the name of each column explicitly seems a lot of work. So I wondered whether there is a way to generate these column names on the fly.

The returned page has a U+2014 character (em-dash) which the print function translates well in the Windows GUI (I presume Code Page 1252) but does not in the Windows Console (Code Page 850).  Given the strict default behavior I get the following error:UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2014' in position 10248: character maps to <undefined>I could fix it using this quite ugly code:print(data.decode('utf-8').encode('cp850''replace').decode('cp850'))Now it replace the offending character — with a ?.

If I port the program for a system using some other encoding (latin-1 cp437 back to cp1252 etc.) it should recognize the target encoding.  It does not.  (for instance when using again the IDLE GUI the emdash is also lost which didn't happen before)It would be nicer if the emdash translated to a hyphen instead of a interrogation bang.The problem is not the emdash (I can think of several ways to solve that particularly problem) but I need to write robust code.

I read in the parameters I used in the last run from a .config file formated asfilenameno_sig_resonance.datmass_peak700choice123When prompted for values the previously used is displayed and an empty string input will use the previously used value.My question comes about because when it comes to writing the dictionary that these values have been scanned into. If a parameter is needed I run get_param which accesses the file and finds the parameter. I think I will avoid the problem all together by reading the .config file once and producing a dictionary from that. I avoided that originally for... reasons I no longer remember. Perfect situation to update my code!","[<code>choice</code><code>In[53]:namestr(choice)Out[53]:'choice'</code><code>filenameno_sig_resonance.datmass_peak700choice123</code><code>get_param</code><code>config</code>]"

Each Client should have a base Rate that is chosen from it's parent Company's Rates not another Company's Rates.When creating a form for adding a Client I would like to remove the Company choices (as that has already been selected via an Add Client button on the Company page) and limit the Rate choices to that Company as well.How do I go about this in Django 1.0?

The plan is:This is geared towards web development. The original and target code will be be sitting on top of frameworks (which I will also have to write). These frameworks will embrace an MVC design pattern and follow strict coding conventions. This should make translation somewhat easier.I am also looking at IOC and dependency injection as they might make the translation process easier and less error prone.I'll make use of Python's parser module which lets me fiddle with the Abstract Syntax Tree. Apparently the closest I can get with PHP is token_get_all() which is a start.From then on I can build the AST symbol tables and control flow.Then I believe I can start outputting code. I don't need a perfect translation. I'll still have to review the generated code and fix problems. Ideally the translator should flag problematic translations.Before you ask What the hell is the point of this? The answer is... It'll be an interesting learning experience.

There is an old format I need to support where the date string does not have a timezone indicator. I've already fixed the data source but I still need to support the legacy data format. A one time conversion of the legacy data is not an option for various business BS reasons. While in general I do not like the idea of hard-coding a default timezone in this case it seems like the best option. I know with reasonable confidence that all the legacy data in question is in UTC so I'm prepared to accept the risk of defaulting to that in this case.","[<code>Python2.6.1(r261:67515Jun24201021:47:49)[GCC4.2.1(AppleInc.build5646)]ondarwinTypehelpcopyrightcreditsorlicenseformoreinformation.importdatetimeimportpytzunaware=datetime.datetime(2011815815120)unawaredatetime.datetime(201181581512)aware=datetime.datetime(2011815815120pytz.UTC)awaredatetime.datetime(201181581512tzinfo=&ltUTC)aware==unawareTraceback(mostrecentcalllast):File&ltstdinline1in&ltmoduleTypeError:can'tcompareoffset-naiveandoffset-awaredatetimes</code><code>unaware.astimezone(pytz.UTC)Traceback(mostrecentcalllast):File&ltstdinline1in&ltmoduleValueError:astimezone()cannotbeappliedtoanaivedatetime</code><code>unaware.replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC)datetime.datetime(201181581512tzinfo=&ltUTC)unaware==awareTraceback(mostrecentcalllast):File&ltstdinline1in&ltmoduleTypeError:can'tcompareoffset-naiveandoffset-awaredatetimes</code>]"

Like if you do it for a list:>>> original = [1 2 3]>>> new = original>>> new.append(4)>>> new original([1 2 3 4] [1 2 3 4])This works as expected.Since both are shallow copies why is that the dict.copy() doesn't work as I expect it to?

Specifically is there a way of specifying 'ether a space or the start of file (i.e. ^) and similar 'either a space or the end of the file (i.e. $)?","[<code>match_middle_words=[^a-zA-Z\d]{0}+word+[^a-zA-Z\d]{0}</code><code>match_starting_word=^[^a-zA-Z\d]{0}+word+[^a-zA-Z\d]{0}match_end_word=[^a-zA-Z\d]{0}+word+[^a-zA-Z\d]{0}$</code><code>match_string=match_middle_words+|+match_starting_word+|+match_end_word</code>]"

And I have completed the task but at the end I found a little problem for which I came here.I did the programming using Python API of OpenCV 2.3.1.Below is what I did :Read the imageFind the contours Select the one with maximum area ( and also somewhat equivalent to square).Find the corner points.e.g. given below:(Notice here that the green line correctly coincides with the true boundary of the Sudoku so the Sudoku can be correctly warped. Check next image)warp the image to a perfect squareeg image:Perform OCR ( for which I used the method I have given in Simple Digit Recognition OCR in OpenCV-Python )And the method worked well.Problem:Check out this image.Performing the step 4 on this image gives the result below:The red line drawn is the original contour which is the true outline of sudoku boundary.The green line drawn is approximated contour which will be the outline of warped image.Which of course there is difference between green line and red line at the top edge of sudoku. So while warping I am not getting the original boundary of the Sudoku.My Question : How can I warp the image on the correct boundary of the Sudoku i.e. the red line OR how can I remove the difference between red line and green line?

I couldn't find any information about how asyncio is actually implemented and what makes I/O asynchronous.  I was trying to read the source code but it's thousands of lines of not the highest grade C code a lot of which deals with auxiliary objects but most crucially it is hard to connect between Python syntax and what C code it would translate into.Asycnio's own documentation is even less helpful.  There's no information there about how it works only some guidelines about how to use it which are also sometimes misleading / very poorly written.I'm familiar with Go's implementation of coroutines and was kind of hoping that Python did the same thing.  If that was the case the code I came up in the post linked above would have worked.  Since it didn't I'm now trying to figure out why.  My best guess so far is as follows please correct me where I'm wrong:Procedure definitions of the form async def foo(): ... are actually interpreted as methods of a class inheriting coroutine.Perhaps async def is actually split into multiple methods by await statements where the object on which these methods are called is able to keep track of the progress it made through the execution so far.If the above is true then essentially execution of a coroutine boils down to calling methods of coroutine object by some global manager (loop?).The global manager is somehow (how?) aware of when I/O operations are performed by Python (only?) code and is able to choose one of the pending coroutine methods to execute after the current executing method relinquished control (hit on the await statement).In other words here's my attempt at desugaring of some asyncio syntax into something more understandable:async def coro(name):    print('before' name)    await asyncio.sleep()    print('after' name)asyncio.gather(coro('first') coro('second'))# translated from async def coro(name)class Coro(coroutine):    def before(self name):        print('before' name)    def after(self name):        print('after' name)    def __init__(self name):        self.name = name        self.parts = self.before self.after        self.pos = 0    def __call__():        self.parts[self.pos](self.name)        self.pos += 1    def done(self):        return self.pos == len(self.parts)# translated from asyncio.gather()class AsyncIOManager:    def gather(*coros):        while not every(c.done() for c in coros):            coro = random.choice(coros)            coro()Should my guess prove correct: then I have a problem.  How does I/O actually happen in this scenario? In a separate thread?  Is the whole interpreter suspended and I/O happens outside the interpreter?  What exactly is meant by I/O?  If my python procedure called C open() procedure and it in turn sent interrupt to kernel relinquishing control to it how does Python interpreter know about this and is able to continue running some other code while kernel code does the actual I/O and until it wakes up the Python procedure which sent the interrupt originally?  How can Python interpreter in principle be aware of this happening?","[<code>asyncio</code><code>asyncio</code><code>asyncdeffoo():...</code><code>coroutine</code><code>asyncdef</code><code>await</code><code>await</code><code>asyncio</code><code>asyncdefcoro(name):print('before'name)awaitasyncio.sleep()print('after'name)asyncio.gather(coro('first')coro('second'))#translatedfromasyncdefcoro(name)classCoro(coroutine):defbefore(selfname):print('before'name)defafter(selfname):print('after'name)def__init__(selfname):self.name=nameself.parts=self.beforeself.afterself.pos=0def__call__():self.parts[self.pos](self.name)self.pos+=1defdone(self):returnself.pos==len(self.parts)#translatedfromasyncio.gather()classAsyncIOManager:defgather(*coros):whilenotevery(c.done()forcincoros):coro=random.choice(coros)coro()</code><code>open()</code>]"

I've found a few similar programs on here that do something similar but nothing quite like what I need.  The one that I found most similar is right here (http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/850927-problem-using-urllib-download-images).  I tried using this code:>>> import urllib>>> image = urllib.URLopener()>>> image.retrieve(http://www.gunnerkrigg.com//comics/00000001.jpg00000001.jpg)('00000001.jpg' <httplib.HTTPMessage instance at 0x1457a80>)I then searched my computer for a file 00000001.jpg but all I found was the cached picture of it.  I'm not even sure it saved the file to my computer.  Once I understand how to get the file downloaded I think I know how to handle the rest.  Essentially just use a for loop and split the string at the '00000000'.'jpg' and increment the '00000000' up to the largest number which I would have to somehow determine.  Any reccomendations on the best way to do this or how to download the file correctly?Thanks!EDIT 6/15/10Here is the completed script it saves the files to any directory you choose.  For some odd reason the files weren't downloading and they just did.  Any suggestions on how to clean it up would be much appreciated.

Usually patterns will be expressed in Python  code using this raw string notation.What is this raw string notation? If you use a raw string format does that mean * is taken as a a literal character rather than a zero-or-more indicator? That obviously can't be right or else regex would completely lose its power. But then if it's a raw string how does it recognize newline characters if \n is literally a backslash and an n?I don't follow.Edit for bounty:I'm trying to understand how a raw string regex matches newlines tabs and character sets e.g. \w for words or \d for digits or all whatnot if raw string patterns don't recognize backslashes as anything more than ordinary characters.

To do so I'm loading all the data into a sqlite database. It's working pretty well but I've decided to add a lot more flexibility efficiency and usability to my db. I plan on later adding planetoids to the simulation and wanted to have a table for each star. This way I wouldn't have to query a table of 20m some planetoids for the 1-4k in each solar system. I've been told using string constructors is bad because it leaves me vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.

And also this way if I do a project with a similar situation where it is open to the public I know what to do.Currently I'm doing this:cursor.execute(CREATE TABLE StarFrame+self.name+ (etc etc))This works but I would like to do something more like:cursor.execute(CREATE TABLE StarFrame(?)

I'm pretty puzzled on how that is doing it because if I wait it does change but not if I try to call the same class two or more times.","[<code>classsomeClass:passprint(someClass())print(someClass())</code><code>print(someClass())print(someClass())&lt__main__.someClassobjectat0x0000000002D96F98&lt__main__.someClassobjectat0x0000000002D96F98</code><code>foriinrange(10):print(someClass())</code>]"

That's perfectly fine for their intended usage but I just want to know if an item is in the list or not (don't want to insert anything).I thought of using bisect_left and then checking if the item at that position is equal to what I'm searching but that seems cumbersome (and I also need to do bounds checking if the number can be larger than the largest number in my list). If there is a nicer method I'd like to know about it.Edit To clarify what I need this for: I'm aware that a dictionary would be very well suited for this but I'm trying to keep the memory consumption as low as possible. My intended usage would be a sort of double-way look-up table. I have in the table a list of values and I need to be able to access the values based on their index. And also I want to be able to find the index of a particular value or None if the value is not in the list.Using a dictionary for this would be the fastest way but would (approximately) double the memory requirements.I was asking this question thinking that I may have overlooked something in the Python libraries.

The value argument becomes    the result of the current yield expression. The send() method returns the next value yielded by the generator or raises StopIteration if the generator exits without yielding another value.What does that mean?

As all my other data are timezone naive (but represented in my local timezone) I want to convert this timeseries to naive to further work with it but it also has to be represented in my local timezone (so just remove the timezone info without converting the user-visible time to UTC).  I know the time is actually internal stored as UTC and only converted to another timezone when you represent it so there has to be some kind of conversion when I want to delocalize it.

(well I'm allowed to change it so I guess there's a reason).Is this a safety issue? that is can an operation fail/misbehave due to inplace = True?Can I know in advance if a certain inplace = True operation will really be carried out in-place?My take so far:Many Pandas operations have an inplace parameter always defaulting to False meaning the original DataFrame is untouched and the operation returns a new DF.When setting inplace = True the operation might work on the original DF but it might still work on a copy behind the scenes and just reassign the reference when done.pros of inplace = True:Can be both faster and less memory hogging (the first link shows reset_index() runs twice as fast and uses half the peak memory!).pros of inplace = False :Allows chained/functional syntax: df.dropna().rename().sum()... which is nice and offers a chance for lazy evaluation or a more efficient re-ordering (though I don't think Pandas is doing this).When using inplace = True on an object which is potentially a slice/view of an underlying DF Pandas has to do a SettingWithCopy check which is expensive. inplace = False avoids this.Consistent & predictable behavior behind the scenes.So putting the copy-vs-view issue aside it seems more performant to always use inplace = True unless specifically writing a chained statement.

Changing figure size doesn't seem to help this and I haven't been able to figure out how to shift the x-axis up to make room for the xlabel.

I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.I made a 2D array of each paw that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's that together have the largest sum.So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well but it also marks neighboring sensors.So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap since they have to be separate toes!Also I took 2x2 as a convenience any more advanced solution is welcome but I'm simply a human movement scientist so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician so please keep it 'simple'.Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxtResultsSo I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see it works very on the front paws but it works less well for the hind legs.More specifically it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value without taking into account where this is.Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?Since I haven't processed any other trials yet I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.Update:I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!New update:So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide it gets recognized twice!The paw is too large so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.Therefore I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?","[<code>np.loadtxt</code><code>neighborhood</code><code>generate_binary_structure</code>]"

The variety of situations in which it is useful are numerous. The existing documentation leaves out a few details on some of the optional arguments. Among them are the levels and keys arguments. I set out to figure out what those arguments do.I'll pose a question that will act as a gateway into many aspects of pd.concat.Consider the data frames d1 d2 and d3:import pandas as pdd1 = pd.DataFrame(dict(A=.1 B=.2 C=.3) [2 3])d2 = pd.DataFrame(dict(B=.4 C=.5 D=.6) [1 2])d3 = pd.DataFrame(dict(A=.7 B=.8 D=.9) [1 3])If I were to concatenate these together withpd.concat([d1 d2 d3] keys=['d1' 'd2' 'd3'])I get the expected result with a pandas.MultiIndex for my columns object:        A    B    C    Dd1 2  0.1  0.2  0.3  NaN   3  0.1  0.2  0.3  NaNd2 1  NaN  0.4  0.5  0.6   2  NaN  0.4  0.5  0.6d3 1  0.7  0.8  NaN  0.9   3  0.7  0.8  NaN  0.9However I wanted to use the levels argument documentation:levels: list of sequences default None.  Specific levels (unique values) to use for constructing a MultiIndex. Otherwise they will be inferred from the keys.So I passedpd.concat([d1 d2 d3] keys=['d1' 'd2' 'd3'] levels=[['d1' 'd2']])And get a KeyErrorValueError: Key d3 not in level Index(['d1' 'd2'] dtype='object')This made sense. The levels I passed were inadequate to describe the necessary levels indicated by the keys. Had I not passed anything as I did above the levels are inferred (as stated in the documentation). But how else can I use this argument to better effect?If I tried this instead:pd.concat([d1 d2 d3] keys=['d1' 'd2' 'd3'] levels=[['d1' 'd2' 'd3']])I and got the same results as above. But when I add one more value to the levelsdf = pd.concat([d1 d2 d3] keys=['d1' 'd2' 'd3'] levels=[['d1' 'd2' 'd3' 'd4']])I end up with the same looking data frame but the resulting MultiIndex has an unused level.df.index.levels[0]Index(['d1' 'd2' 'd3' 'd4'] dtype='object')So what is the point of the level argument and should I be using keys differently?I'm using Python 3.6 and Pandas 0.22.","[<code>pd.concat</code><code>levels</code><code>keys</code><code>concat</code><code>levels</code><code>keys</code><code>pd.concat</code><code>d1</code><code>d2</code><code>d3</code><code>importpandasaspdd1=pd.DataFrame(dict(A=.1B=.2C=.3)[23])d2=pd.DataFrame(dict(B=.4C=.5D=.6)[12])d3=pd.DataFrame(dict(A=.7B=.8D=.9)[13])</code><code>pd.concat([d1d2d3]keys=['d1''d2''d3'])</code><code>pandas.MultiIndex</code><code>columns</code><code>ABCDd120.10.20.3NaN30.10.20.3NaNd21NaN0.40.50.62NaN0.40.50.6d310.70.8NaN0.930.70.8NaN0.9</code><code>levels</code><code>pd.concat([d1d2d3]keys=['d1''d2''d3']levels=[['d1''d2']])</code><code>KeyError</code><code>ValueError:Keyd3notinlevelIndex(['d1''d2']dtype='object')</code><code>pd.concat([d1d2d3]keys=['d1''d2''d3']levels=[['d1''d2''d3']])</code><code>df=pd.concat([d1d2d3]keys=['d1''d2''d3']levels=[['d1''d2''d3''d4']])</code><code>MultiIndex</code><code>df.index.levels[0]Index(['d1''d2''d3''d4']dtype='object')</code><code>level</code><code>keys</code>]"

First contains bitarrays (module bitarray 0.8.0) and the other two contain arrays of integers.l1=[bitarray 1 bitarray 2 ... bitarray n]l2=[array 1 array 2 ...  array n]l3=[array 1 array 2 ...  array n]These data structures take quite a bit of RAM (~16GB total).If i start 12 sub-processes using:multiprocessing.Process(target=someFunction args=(l1l2l3))Does this mean that l1 l2 and l3 will be copied for each sub-process or will the sub-processes share these lists? Or to be more direct will I use 16GB or 192GB of RAM?someFunction will read some values from these lists and then performs some calculations based on the values read. The results will be returned to the parent-process. The lists l1 l2 and l3 will not be modified by someFunction.Therefore i would assume that the sub-processes do not need and would not copy these huge lists but would instead just share them with the parent. Meaning that the program would take 16GB of RAM (regardless of how many sub-processes i start) due to the copy-on-write approach under linux?Am i correct or am i missing something that would cause the lists to be copied?EDIT:I am still confused after reading a bit more on the subject. On the one hand Linux uses copy-on-write which should mean that no data is copied. On the other hand accessing the object will change its ref-count (i am still unsure why and what does that mean). Even so will the entire object be copied?For example if i define someFunction as follows:def someFunction(list1 list2 list3):    i=random.randint(099999)    print list1[i] list2[i] list3[i]Would using this function mean that l1 l2 and l3 will be copied entirely for each sub-process?Is there a way to check for this?EDIT2 After reading a bit more and monitoring total memory usage of the system while sub-processes are running it seems that entire objects are indeed copied for each sub-process. And it seems to be because reference counting.The reference counting for l1 l2 and l3 is actually unneeded in my program. This is because l1 l2 and l3 will be kept in memory (unchanged) until the parent-process exits. There is no need to free the memory used by these lists until then. In fact i know for sure that the reference count will remain above 0 (for these lists and every object in these lists) until the program exits. So now the question becomes how can i make sure that the objects will not be copied to each sub-process? Can i perhaps disable reference counting for these lists and each object in these lists?EDIT3 Just an additional note. Sub-processes do not need to modify l1 l2 and l3 or any objects in these lists. The sub-processes only need to be able to reference some of these objects without causing the memory to be copied for each sub-process.","[<code>l1=[bitarray1bitarray2...bitarrayn]l2=[array1array2...arrayn]l3=[array1array2...arrayn]</code><code>multiprocessing.Process(target=someFunctionargs=(l1l2l3))</code><code>defsomeFunction(list1list2list3):i=random.randint(099999)printlist1[i]list2[i]list3[i]</code><code>l1</code><code>l2</code><code>l3</code>]"

The comment that is made repeatedly in these discussions is that a circular import is a sign of a bad design and the code should be reorganised to avoid the circular import.Could someone tell me how to avoid a circular import in this situation?: I have two classes and I want each class to have a constructor (method) which takes an instance of the other class and returns an instance of the class.More specifically one class is mutable and one is immutable. The immutable class is neededfor hashing comparing and so on. The mutable class is needed to do things too. This is similar to sets and frozensets or to lists and tuples.I could put both class definitions in the same module. Are there any other suggestions?A toy example would be class A which has an attribute which is a list and class B which has an attribute which is a tuple. Then class A has a method which takes an instance of class B and returns an instance of class A (by converting the tuple to a list) and similarly class B has a method which takes an instance of class A and returns an instance of class B (by converting the list to a tuple).

The best thing I have so far is:driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//div[contains(text() ' + text + ')]')This is case-sensitive however. The other thing I've tried is iterating through all the divs on the page and checking the element.text property. However every time you get a situation of the form:<div class=outer><div class=inner>My Button</div></div>div.outer also has My Button as the text. To fix that I've tried looking to see if div.outer is the parent of div.inner but I couldn't figure out how to do that (element.get_element_by_xpath('..') returns an element's parent but it tests not equal to div.outer).Also iterating through all the elements on the page seems to be really slow at least using the Chrome webdriver.Ideas?I asked (and answered) a more specific version here: How to get text of an element in Selenium WebDriver without including child element text?","[<code>&ltdivMyButton&lt/div</code><code>driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//div[contains(text()'+text+')]')</code><code>&ltdivclass=outer&ltdivclass=innerMyButton&lt/div&lt/div</code>]"

I'm currently just running some tests to see roughly how long dealing with this stuff is going to take to see where to go from here. Here is the code I'm using to test:from datetime import datetimeimport jsonprint datetime.now()f = open('file.json' 'r')json.load(f)f.close()print datetime.now()Not too surprisingly Python gives me a MemoryError. It appears that json.load() calls json.loads(f.read()) which is trying to dump the entire file into memory first which clearly isn't going to work.Any way I can solve this cleanly?I know this is old but I don't think this is a duplicate. While the answer is the same the question is different. In the duplicate the question is how to read large files efficiently whereas this question deals with files that won't even fit in to memory at all. Efficiency isn't required.","[<code>fromdatetimeimportdatetimeimportjsonprintdatetime.now()f=open('file.json''r')json.load(f)f.close()printdatetime.now()</code>]"

Are there alternatives I'm not thinking of?","[<code>multiprocessing</code><code>multiprocessing</code><code>LOG=multiprocessing.get_logger()</code><code>sys.stderr</code>]"

Since this retrieval takes a while this causes the UI to be unresponsive during the retrieval process (it cannot be split into smaller parts). This is why I'd like to outsource the web connection to a separate worker thread.[Yes I know now I have two problems.]Anyway the application uses PyQt4 so I'd like to know what the better choice is: Use Qt's threads or use the Python threading module? What are advantages / disadvantages of each? Or do you have a totally different suggestion?Edit (re bounty): While the solution in my particular case will probably be using a non-blocking network request like Jeff Ober and Lukáš Lalinský suggested (so basically leaving the concurrency problems to the networking implementation) I'd still like a more in-depth answer to the general question:What are advantages and disadvantages of using PyQt4's (i.e. Qt's) threads over native Python threads (from the threading module)?Edit 2: Thanks all for you answers. Although there's no 100% agreement there seems to be widespread consensus that the answer is use Qt since the advantage of that is integration with the rest of the library while causing no real disadvantages.For anyone looking to choose between the two threading implementations I highly recommend they read all the answers provided here including the PyQt mailing list thread that abbot links to.There were several answers I considered for the bounty; in the end I chose abbot's for the very relevant external reference; it was however a close call.Thanks again.","[<code>threading</code><code>threading</code>]"

SparkContext can only be used on the driver not in code that it run on workers. For more information see SPARK-5063.Instead of that official documentation recommends something like this:predictions = model.predict(testData.map(lambda x: x.features))labelsAndPredictions = testData.map(lambda lp: lp.label).zip(predictions)So what is going on here? There is no broadcast variable here and Scala API defines predict as follows:/** * Predict values for a single data point using the model trained. * * @param features array representing a single data point * @return Double prediction from the trained model */def predict(features: Vector): Double = {  topNode.predict(features)}/** * Predict values for the given data set using the model trained. * * @param features RDD representing data points to be predicted * @return RDD of predictions for each of the given data points */def predict(features: RDD[Vector]): RDD[Double] = {  features.map(x => predict(x))}so at least at the first glance calling from action or transformation is not a problem since prediction seems to be a local operation. ExplanationAfter some digging I figured out that the source of the problem is a JavaModelWrapper.call method invoked from DecisionTreeModel.predict. It access SparkContext which is required to call Java function:callJavaFunc(self._sc getattr(self._java_model name) *a)QuestionIn case of DecisionTreeModel.predict there is a recommended workaround and all the required code is already a part of the Scala API but is there any elegant way to handle problem like this in general?

The objective is to filter large floating point arrays up to 5000x5000 x 16 layers in size a task that scipy.ndimage.filters.convolve is fairly slow at.Note that I am looking for 8-neighbour connectivity that is a 3x3 filter takes the average of 9 pixels (8 around the focal pixel) and assigns that value to the pixel in the new image.import numpy scipyfiltsize = 3a = numpy.arange(100).reshape((1010))b = numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(a shape=(a.sizefiltsize) strides=(a.itemsize a.itemsize))for i in range(0 filtsize-1):    if i > 0:        b += numpy.roll(b -(pow(filtsize2)+1)*i 0)filtered = (numpy.sum(b 1) / pow(filtsize2)).reshape((a.shape[0]a.shape[1]))scipy.misc.imsave(average.jpg filtered)EDIT Clarification on how I see this working:Current code:use stride_tricks to generate an array like [[012][123][234]...] which corresponds to the top row of the filter kernel.Roll along the vertical axis to get the middle row of the kernel [[101112][111213][131415]...] and add it to the array I got in 1)Repeat to get the bottom row of the kernel [[202122][212223][222324]...]. At this point I take the sum of each row and divide it by the number of elements in the filter giving me the average for each pixel (shifted by 1 row and 1 col and with some oddities around edges but I can take care of that later).What I was hoping for is a better use of stride_tricks to get the 9 values or the sum of the kernel elements directly for the entire array or that someone can convince me of another more efficient method...","[<code>scipy.ndimage.filters.convolve</code><code>importnumpyscipyfiltsize=3a=numpy.arange(100).reshape((1010))b=numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(ashape=(a.sizefiltsize)strides=(a.itemsizea.itemsize))foriinrange(0filtsize-1):ifi0:b+=numpy.roll(b-(pow(filtsize2)+1)*i0)filtered=(numpy.sum(b1)/pow(filtsize2)).reshape((a.shape[0]a.shape[1]))scipy.misc.imsave(average.jpgfiltered)</code>]"

Ideally I'd like to make the default method able to handle all the datatypes that the original encoder chokes on (I'm using Mongo as a data source so dates seem to raise this error too)Any hint in the right direction would be appreciated.EDIT:Thanks for the answer!  Perhaps I should have been more precise.I utilized (and upvoted) the answers here to get around the limitations of the set being translated but there are internal keys that are an issue as well.The objects in the set are complex objects that translate to __dict__ but they themselves can also contain values for their properties that could be ineligible for the basic types in the json encoder.There's a lot of different types coming into this set and the hash basically calculates a unique id for the entity but in the true spirit of NoSQL there's no telling exactly what the child object contains.One object might contain a date value for starts whereas another may have some other schema that includes no keys containing non-primitive objects.That is why the only solution I could think of was to extend the JSONEncoder to replace the default method to turn on different cases - but I'm not sure how to go about this and the documentation is ambiguous.  In nested objects does the value returned from default go by key or is it just a generic include/discard that looks at the whole object?  How does that method accommodate nested values?  I've looked through previous questions and can't seem to find the best approach to case-specific encoding (which unfortunately seems like what I'm going to need to do here).","[<code>set</code><code>__hash__</code><code>__eq__</code><code>set</code><code>set</code><code>json.dumps</code><code>TypeError</code><code>File/usr/lib/python2.7/json/encoder.pyline201inencodechunks=self.iterencode(o_one_shot=True)File/usr/lib/python2.7/json/encoder.pyline264initerencodereturn_iterencode(o0)File/usr/lib/python2.7/json/encoder.pyline178indefaultraiseTypeError(repr(o)+isnotJSONserializable)TypeError:set([])isnotJSONserializable</code><code>json.JSONEncoder</code><code>default</code><code>set</code><code>set</code><code>set</code><code>set</code><code>__dict__</code><code>set</code><code>starts</code><code>JSONEncoder</code><code>default</code><code>default</code>]"

For example it should match this:for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++);... but not this:for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)This looks trivial at first glance until you realise that the text between the opening and closing parenthesis may contain other parenthesis for example:for (int i = funcA(); i < funcB(); i++);I'm using the python.re module. Right now my regular expression looks like this (I've left my comments in so you can understand it easier):# match any line that begins with a for or while statement:^\s*(for|while)\s*\(  # match the initial opening parenthesis    # Now make a named group 'balanced' which matches a balanced substring.

That sounds heavy and complex:A['dummy'] = 1B['dummy'] = 1Temp = pd.merge(ABon='dummy')Result = Temp[Temp.A_value.between(Temp.B_lowTemp.B_high)]Another solution that I had is by applying on each of A value a search function on B by usingB[(x>=B.B_low) & (x<=B.B_high)] mask but it sounds inefficient as well and might require index optimization.Is there a more elegant and/or efficient way to perform this action?","[<code>SELECT*FROMABWHEREA_valuebetweenB_lowandB_high</code><code>A['dummy']=1B['dummy']=1Temp=pd.merge(ABon='dummy')Result=Temp[Temp.A_value.between(Temp.B_lowTemp.B_high)]</code><code>B[(x=B.B_low)&amp(x&lt=B.B_high)]</code>]"

Can it speed up execution time?","I'm slightly confused about whether multithreading works in Python or not. I know there has been a lot of questions about this and I've read many of them but I'm still confused. I know from my own experience and have seen others post their own answers and examples here on StackOverflow that multithreading is indeed possible in Python. So why is it that everyone keep saying that Python is locked by the GIL and that only one thread can run at a time? It clearly does work. Or is there some distinction I'm not getting here? Many posters/respondents also keep mentioning that threading is limited because it does not make use of multiple cores. But I would say they are still useful because they do work simultaneously and thus get the combined workload done faster. I mean why would there even be a Python thread module otherwise?Update:Thanks for all the answers so far. The way I understand it is that multithreading will only run in parallel for some IO tasks but can only run one at a time for CPU-bound multiple core tasks.I'm not entirely sure what this means for me in practical terms so I'll just give an example of the kind of task I'd like to multithread. For instance let's say I want to loop through a very long list of strings and I want to do some basic string operations on each list item. If I split up the list send each sublist to be processed by my loop/string code in a new thread and send the results back in a queue will these workloads run roughly at the same time? Most importantly will this theoretically speed up the time it takes to run the script? Another example might be if I can render and save four different pictures using PIL in four different threads and have this be faster than processing the pictures one by one after each other? I guess this speed-component is what I'm really wondering about rather than what the correct terminology is.I also know about the multiprocessing module but my main interest right now is for small-to-medium task loads (10-30 secs) and so I think multithreading will be more appropriate because subprocesses can be slow to initiate.

(I can set the labels on the default minor ticks set by pandas.plot)Here is my test code:import pandasprint 'pandas.__version__ is ' pandas.__version__print 'matplotlib.__version__ is ' matplotlib.__version__    dStart = datetime.datetime(201151) # 1 MaydEnd = datetime.datetime(201171) # 1 July    dateIndex = pandas.date_range(start=dStart end=dEnd freq='D')print 1 May to 1 July 2011 dateIndex      testSeries = pandas.Series(data=np.random.randn(len(dateIndex))                           index=dateIndex)    ax = plt.figure(figsize=(74) dpi=300).add_subplot(111)testSeries.plot(ax=ax style='v-' label='first line')    # using MatPlotLib date time locators and formatters doesn't work with new# pandas datetime indexax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(matplotlib.dates.WeekdayLocator(byweekday=(1)                                                           interval=1))ax.xaxis.set_minor_formatter(matplotlib.dates.DateFormatter('%d\n%a'))ax.xaxis.grid(True which=minor)ax.xaxis.grid(False which=major)ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(matplotlib.dates.DateFormatter('\n\n\n%b%Y'))plt.show()    # set the major xticks and labels through pandasax2 = plt.figure(figsize=(74) dpi=300).add_subplot(111)xticks = pandas.date_range(start=dStart end=dEnd freq='W-Tue')print xticks:  xtickstestSeries.plot(ax=ax2 style='-v' label='second line'                xticks=xticks.to_pydatetime())ax2.set_xticklabels([x.strftime('%a\n%d\n%h\n%Y') for x in xticks]);# set the text of the first few minor ticks created by pandas.plot#    ax2.set_xticklabels(['a''b''c''d''e'] minor=True)# remove the minor xtick labels set by pandas.plot ax2.set_xticklabels([] minor=True)# turn the minor ticks created by pandas.plot off # plt.minorticks_off()plt.show()print testSeries['6/4/2011':'6/7/2011']and its output:pandas.__version__ is  0.9.1.dev-3de54aematplotlib.__version__ is  1.1.11 May to 1 July 2011 <class 'pandas.tseries.index.DatetimeIndex'>[2011-05-01 00:00:00 ... 2011-07-01 00:00:00]Length: 62 Freq: D Timezone: Nonexticks:  <class 'pandas.tseries.index.DatetimeIndex'>[2011-05-03 00:00:00 ... 2011-06-28 00:00:00]Length: 9 Freq: W-TUE Timezone: None2011-06-04   -0.1993932011-06-05   -0.0431182011-06-06    0.4777712011-06-07   -0.033207Freq: DUpdate: I've been able to get closer to the layout I wanted by using a loop to build the major xtick labels:# only show month for first label in monthmonth = dStart.month - 1xticklabels = []for x in xticks:    if  month != x.month :        xticklabels.append(x.strftime('%d\n%a\n%h'))        month = x.month    else:        xticklabels.append(x.strftime('%d\n%a'))However this is a bit like doing the x-axis using ax.annotate: possible but not ideal.","[<code>ax.xaxis.set_major_locator</code><code>ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter</code><code>importpandasprint'pandas.__version__is'pandas.__version__print'matplotlib.__version__is'matplotlib.__version__dStart=datetime.datetime(201151)#1MaydEnd=datetime.datetime(201171)#1JulydateIndex=pandas.date_range(start=dStartend=dEndfreq='D')print1Mayto1July2011dateIndextestSeries=pandas.Series(data=np.random.randn(len(dateIndex))index=dateIndex)ax=plt.figure(figsize=(74)dpi=300).add_subplot(111)testSeries.plot(ax=axstyle='v-'label='firstline')#usingMatPlotLibdatetimelocatorsandformattersdoesn'tworkwithnew#pandasdatetimeindexax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(matplotlib.dates.WeekdayLocator(byweekday=(1)interval=1))ax.xaxis.set_minor_formatter(matplotlib.dates.DateFormatter('%d\n%a'))ax.xaxis.grid(Truewhich=minor)ax.xaxis.grid(Falsewhich=major)ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(matplotlib.dates.DateFormatter('\n\n\n%b%Y'))plt.show()#setthemajorxticksandlabelsthroughpandasax2=plt.figure(figsize=(74)dpi=300).add_subplot(111)xticks=pandas.date_range(start=dStartend=dEndfreq='W-Tue')printxticks:xtickstestSeries.plot(ax=ax2style='-v'label='secondline'xticks=xticks.to_pydatetime())ax2.set_xticklabels([x.strftime('%a\n%d\n%h\n%Y')forxinxticks])#setthetextofthefirstfewminortickscreatedbypandas.plot#ax2.set_xticklabels(['a''b''c''d''e']minor=True)#removetheminorxticklabelssetbypandas.plotax2.set_xticklabels([]minor=True)#turntheminortickscreatedbypandas.plotoff#plt.minorticks_off()plt.show()printtestSeries['6/4/2011':'6/7/2011']</code><code>pandas.__version__is0.9.1.dev-3de54aematplotlib.__version__is1.1.11Mayto1July2011&ltclass'pandas.tseries.index.DatetimeIndex'[2011-05-0100:00:00...2011-07-0100:00:00]Length:62Freq:DTimezone:None</code><code>xticks:&ltclass'pandas.tseries.index.DatetimeIndex'[2011-05-0300:00:00...2011-06-2800:00:00]Length:9Freq:W-TUETimezone:None</code><code>2011-06-04-0.1993932011-06-05-0.0431182011-06-060.4777712011-06-07-0.033207Freq:D</code><code>#onlyshowmonthforfirstlabelinmonthmonth=dStart.month-1xticklabels=[]forxinxticks:ifmonth!=x.month:xticklabels.append(x.strftime('%d\n%a\n%h'))month=x.monthelse:xticklabels.append(x.strftime('%d\n%a'))</code><code>ax.annotate</code>]"

For example it might convert all arguments to a specific type perform logging implement memoization etc.Here is an example:def args_as_ints(f):    def g(*args **kwargs):        args = [int(x) for x in args]        kwargs = dict((k int(v)) for k v in kwargs.items())        return f(*args **kwargs)    return g@args_as_intsdef funny_function(x y z=3):    Computes x*y + 2*z    return x*y + 2*z>>> funny_function(3 4.0 z=5)22Everything well so far. There is one problem however. The decorated function does not retain the documentation of the original function:>>> help(funny_function)Help on function g in module __main__:g(*args **kwargs)Fortunately there is a workaround:def args_as_ints(f):    def g(*args **kwargs):        args = [int(x) for x in args]        kwargs = dict((k int(v)) for k v in kwargs.items())        return f(*args **kwargs)    g.__name__ = f.__name__    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__    return g@args_as_intsdef funny_function(x y z=3):    Computes x*y + 2*z    return x*y + 2*zThis time the function name and documentation are correct:>>> help(funny_function)Help on function funny_function in module __main__:funny_function(*args **kwargs)    Computes x*y + 2*zBut there is still a problem: the function signature is wrong. The information *args **kwargs is next to useless.What to do? I can think of two simple but flawed workarounds:1 -- Include the correct signature in the docstring:def funny_function(x y z=3):    funny_function(x y z=3) -- computes x*y + 2*z    return x*y + 2*zThis is bad because of the duplication. The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It's easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring or to make a typo. [And yes I'm aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.]2 -- Not use a decorator or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:def funny_functions_decorator(f):    def g(x y z=3):        return f(int(x) int(y) z=int(z))    g.__name__ = f.__name__    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__    return gThis works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature but it's useless in general. As I said in the beginning I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.I'm looking for a solution that is fully general and automatic.So the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?Otherwise can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of *kwargs **kwargs when constructing the decorated function? How do I extract that information? How should I construct the decorated function -- with exec?Any other approaches?","[<code>defargs_as_ints(f):defg(*args**kwargs):args=[int(x)forxinargs]kwargs=dict((kint(v))forkvinkwargs.items())returnf(*args**kwargs)returng@args_as_intsdeffunny_function(xyz=3):Computesx*y+2*zreturnx*y+2*zfunny_function(34.0z=5)22</code><code>help(funny_function)Helponfunctionginmodule__main__:g(*args**kwargs)</code><code>defargs_as_ints(f):defg(*args**kwargs):args=[int(x)forxinargs]kwargs=dict((kint(v))forkvinkwargs.items())returnf(*args**kwargs)g.__name__=f.__name__g.__doc__=f.__doc__returng@args_as_intsdeffunny_function(xyz=3):Computesx*y+2*zreturnx*y+2*z</code><code>help(funny_function)Helponfunctionfunny_functioninmodule__main__:funny_function(*args**kwargs)Computesx*y+2*z</code><code>deffunny_function(xyz=3):funny_function(xyz=3)--computesx*y+2*zreturnx*y+2*z</code><code>deffunny_functions_decorator(f):defg(xyz=3):returnf(int(x)int(y)z=int(z))g.__name__=f.__name__g.__doc__=f.__doc__returng</code>]"

I'm pretty new to Pandas though so still trying to wrap my head around everything.TL;DRI want to take a dictionary of the following form and apply each operation to a given Series object and return a 'filtered' Series object.relops = {'>=': [1] '<=': [1]}Long ExampleI'll start with an example of what I have currently and just filtering a single Series object.  Below is the function I'm currently using:   def apply_relops(series relops):                Pass dictionary of relational operators to perform on given series object                for op vals in relops.iteritems():            op_func = ops[op]            for val in vals:                filtered = op_func(series val)                series = series.reindex(series[filtered])        return seriesThe user provides a dictionary with the operations they want to perform:>>> df = pandas.DataFrame({'col1': [0 1 2] 'col2': [10 11 12]})>>> print df>>> print df   col1  col20     0    101     1    112     2    12>>> from operator import le ge>>> ops ={'>=': ge '<=': le}>>> apply_relops(df['col1'] {'>=': [1]})col11       12       2Name: col1>>> apply_relops(df['col1'] relops = {'>=': [1] '<=': [1]})col11       1Name: col1Again the 'problem' with my above approach is that I think there is a lot of possibly unnecessary copying of the data for the in-between steps.Also I would like to expand this so that the dictionary passed in can include the columns to operator on and filter an entire DataFrame based on the input dictionary.  However I'm assuming whatever works for the Series can be easily expanded to a DataFrame.","[<code>reindex()</code><code>apply()</code><code>map()</code><code>relops={'=':[1]'&lt=':[1]}</code><code>defapply_relops(seriesrelops):Passdictionaryofrelationaloperatorstoperformongivenseriesobjectforopvalsinrelops.iteritems():op_func=ops[op]forvalinvals:filtered=op_func(seriesval)series=series.reindex(series[filtered])returnseries</code><code>df=pandas.DataFrame({'col1':[012]'col2':[101112]})printdfprintdfcol1col2001011112212fromoperatorimportlegeops={'=':ge'&lt=':le}apply_relops(df['col1']{'=':[1]})col11122Name:col1apply_relops(df['col1']relops={'=':[1]'&lt=':[1]})col111Name:col1</code>]"

I have not seen a good discussion of the speed difference between df.apply() and np.vectorize() so I thought I would ask here. The Pandas apply() function is slow. From what I measured (shown below in some experiments) using np.vectorize() is 25x faster (or more) than using the DataFrame function apply()  at least on my 2016 MacBook Pro. Is this an expected result and why? For example suppose I have the following dataframe with N rows:N = 10A_list = np.random.randint(1 100 N)B_list = np.random.randint(1 100 N)df = pd.DataFrame({'A': A_list 'B': B_list})df.head()#     A   B# 0  78  50# 1  23  91# 2  55  62# 3  82  64# 4  99  80Suppose further that I want to create a new column as a function of the two columns A and B. In the example below I'll use a simple function divide(). To apply the function I can use either df.apply() or np.vectorize():def divide(a b):    if b == 0:        return 0.0    return float(a)/bdf['result'] = df.apply(lambda row: divide(row['A'] row['B']) axis=1)df['result2'] = np.vectorize(divide)(df['A'] df['B'])df.head()#     A   B    result   result2# 0  78  50  1.560000  1.560000# 1  23  91  0.252747  0.252747# 2  55  62  0.887097  0.887097# 3  82  64  1.281250  1.281250# 4  99  80  1.237500  1.237500If I increase N to real-world sizes like 1 million or more then I observe that np.vectorize() is 25x faster or more than df.apply().Below is some complete benchmarking code:import pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport timedef divide(a b):    if b == 0:        return 0.0    return float(a)/bfor N in [1000 10000 100000 1000000 10000000]:        print ''    A_list = np.random.randint(1 100 N)    B_list = np.random.randint(1 100 N)    df = pd.DataFrame({'A': A_list 'B': B_list})    start_epoch_sec = int(time.time())    df['result'] = df.apply(lambda row: divide(row['A'] row['B']) axis=1)    end_epoch_sec = int(time.time())    result_apply = end_epoch_sec - start_epoch_sec    start_epoch_sec = int(time.time())    df['result2'] = np.vectorize(divide)(df['A'] df['B'])    end_epoch_sec = int(time.time())    result_vectorize = end_epoch_sec - start_epoch_sec    print 'N=%d df.apply: %d sec np.vectorize: %d sec' % \            (N result_apply result_vectorize)    # Make sure results from df.apply and np.vectorize match.    assert(df['result'].equals(df['result2']))The results are shown below:N=1000 df.apply: 0 sec np.vectorize: 0 secN=10000 df.apply: 1 sec np.vectorize: 0 secN=100000 df.apply: 2 sec np.vectorize: 0 secN=1000000 df.apply: 24 sec np.vectorize: 1 secN=10000000 df.apply: 262 sec np.vectorize: 4 secIf np.vectorize() is in general always faster than df.apply() then why is np.vectorize() not mentioned more?

This works for my particular usage but I'm not sure if sys.path[0] might fail in some other use case.So my question is: What is the best and most reliable way to open a file that's in the same directory as the currently running Python script?Here's what I've been able to figure out so far:os.getcwd() and os.path.abspath('') return the current working directory not the script directory.os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0]) and os.path.dirname(__file__) return the path used to call the script which may be relative or even blank (if the script is in the cwd). Also __file__ does not exist when the script is run in IDLE or PythonWin.sys.path[0] and os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0])) seem to return the script directory. I'm not sure if there's any difference between these two.Edit:I just realized that what I want to do would be better described as open a file in the same directory as the containing module. In other words if I import a module I wrote that's in another directory and that module opens a file I want it to look for the file in the module's directory.

The log file is being constantly written to by another program.My question: If I open the file using the open() method will my Python file object be updated as the actual file gets written to by the other program or will I have to reopen the file at timed intervals?UPDATE: Thanks for answers so far. I perhaps should have mentioned that the file is being written to by a Java EE app so I have no control over when data gets written to it. I've currently got a program that reopens the file every 10 seconds and tries to read from the byte position in the file that it last read up to.

I want that decorator when invoked to be able to set an attribute on the class defining the method (in order to register it in a list of methods that serve a particular purpose).In Python 2 the im_class method accomplishes this nicely:def decorator(method):  cls = method.im_class  cls.foo = 'bar'  return methodHowever in Python 3 no such attribute (or a  replacement for it) seems to exist. I suppose the idea was that you could call type(method.__self__) to get the class but this does not work for unbound methods since __self__ == None in that case.NOTE: This question is actually a bit irrelevant for my case since I've chosen instead to set an attribute on the method itself and then have the instance scan through all of its methods looking for that attribute at the appropriate time. I am also (currently) using Python 2.6. However I am curious if there is any replacement for the version 2 functionality and if not what the rationale was for removing it completely.EDIT: I just found this question.

Through other questions on stackoverflow here and here I found the algorithm by Philip J. Schneider from Graphics Gems. I successfully implemented it and can report that even with thousands of points it is very fast. Unfortunately that speed comes with some disadvantages namely that the fitting is done quite sloppily. Consider the following graphic:The red dots are my original data and the blue line is the multi segment bezier created by the algorithm by Schneider. As you can see the input to the algorithm was a tolerance which is at least as high as the green line indicates. Nevertheless the algorithm creates a bezier curve which has too many sharp turns. You see too of these unnecessary sharp turns in the image. It is easy to imagine a bezier curve with less sharp turns for the shown data while still maintaining the maximum tolerance condition (just push the bezier curve a bit into the direction of the magenta arrows). The problem seems to be that the algorithm picks data points from my original data as end points of the individual bezier curves (the magenta arrows point indicate some suspects). With the endpoints of the bezier curves restricted like that it is clear that the algorithm will sometimes produce rather sharp curvatures.What I am looking for is an algorithm which approximates my data with a multi segment bezier curve with two constraints:the multi segment bezier curve must never be more than a certain distance away from the data points (this is provided by the algorithm by Schneider)the multi segment bezier curve must never create curvatures that are too sharp. One way to check for this criteria would be to roll a circle with the minimum curvature radius along the multisegment bezier curve and check whether it touches all parts of the curve along its path. Though it seems there is a better method involving the cross product of the first and second derivativeThe solutions I found which create better fits sadly either work only for single bezier curves (and omit the question of how to find good start and end points for each bezier curve in the multi segment bezier curve) or do not allow a minimum curvature contraint. I feel that the minimum curvature contraint is the tricky condition here.Here another example (this is hand drawn and not 100% precise):Lets suppose that figure one shows both the curvature constraint (the circle must fit along the whole curve) as well as the maximum distance of any data point from the curve (which happens to be the radius of the circle in green). A successful approximation of the red path in figure two is shown in blue. That approximation honors the curvature condition (the circle can roll inside the whole curve and touches it everywhere) as well as the distance condition (shown in green). Figure three shows a different approximation to the path. While it honors the distance condition it is clear that the circle does not fit into the curvature any more. Figure four shows a path which is impossible to be approximated with the given constraints because it is too pointy. This example is supposed to illustrate that to properly approximate some pointy turns in the path it is necessary that the algorithm chooses control points which are not part of the path. Figure three shows that if control points along the path were chosen the curvature constraint cannot be fulfilled anymore. This example also shows that the algorithm must quit on some inputs as it is not possible to approximate it with the given constraints.Does there exist a solution to this problem? The solution does not have to be fast. If it takes a day to process 1000 points then that's fine. The solution does also not have to be optimal in the sense that it must result in a least squares fit.In the end I will implement this in C and Python but I can read most other languages too.","[]"

What's left in the 'upload_to' path is 2 files one that is the actual image and one that is the name of the imagebut is empty and of course the ImageField path is set to the empty file that Django try to create.In case that was unclear I'll try to illustrate:## Image generation code runs.... /Upload     generated_image.jpg     4kb## Attempt to set the ImageField path.../Upload     generated_image.jpg     4kb     generated_image_.jpg    0kbImageField.Path = /Upload/generated_image_.jpgHow can I do this without having Django try to re-store the file?

Shrinking the axes however is not an ideal solution because it makes the data smaller making it actually more difficult to interpret; particularly when its complex and there are lots of things going on ... hence needing a large legendThe example of a complex legend in the documentation demonstrates the need for this because the legend in their plot actually completely obscures multiple data points.http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/legend_guide.html#legend-of-complex-plots What I would like to be able to do is dynamically expand the size of the figure box to accommodate the expanding figure legend.import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.arange(-2*np.pi 2*np.pi 0.1)fig = plt.figure(1)ax = fig.add_subplot(111)ax.plot(x np.sin(x) label='Sine')ax.plot(x np.cos(x) label='Cosine')ax.plot(x np.arctan(x) label='Inverse tan')lgd = ax.legend(loc=9 bbox_to_anchor=(0.50))ax.grid('on')Notice how the final label 'Inverse tan' is actually outside the figure box (and looks badly cutoff - not publication quality!)Finally I've been told that this is normal behaviour in R and LaTeX so I'm a little confused why this is so difficult in python...

The big object is accessed read-only I don't need to pass modifications of it between processes.My question is: is the big object loaded into shared memory as it would be if I spawned a process in unix/c or does each process load its own copy of the big object? Update: to clarify further - big_lookup_object is a shared lookup object. I don't need to split that up and process it separately. I need to keep a single copy of it. The work that I need to split it is reading lots of other large files and looking up the items in those large files against the lookup object.Further update: database is a fine solution memcached might be a better solution and file on disk (shelve or dbm) might be even better. In this question I was particularly interested in an in memory solution. For the final solution I'll be using hadoop but I wanted to see if I can have a local in-memory version as well.","[<code>do_some_processing(filename):forlineinfile(filename):ifline.split('')[0]inbig_lookup_object:#somethinghereif__name__=='__main__':big_lookup_object=marshal.load('file.bin')pool=Pool(processes=4)printpool.map(do_some_processingglob.glob('*.data'))</code>]"

So you are either forced to use the overkill prefix all the time or use the unsafe way as in version #1 and disallowed by Python to use the safe handy way? The better way which is safe and avoid unecessary long prefix is the only one which Python reject? Is this because it loves import * or because it loves overlong prefixes (which does not help to enforce this practice)?.Sorry for the hard words but that's two days I trying to work around this stupid‑like behavior. Unless I was totally wrong somewhere this will leave me with a feeling something is really broken in Python's model of package and sub‑packages.Notes I don't want to rely on sys.path to avoid global side effects nor on *.pth files which are just another way to play with sys.path with the same global effets. For the solution to be clean it has to be local only. Either Python is able to handle subpackage either it's not but it should not require to play with global configuration to be able to handle local stuff.I also tried use imports in package/subpackage/__init__.py but it solved nothing it do the same and complains subpackage is not a known module while print subpackage says it's a module (weird behavior again).May be I'm entirely wrong tough (the option I would prefer) but this make me feel a lot disappointed about Python.Any other known way beside of the three I tried? Something I don't know about?(sigh)----- %< ----- edit ----- >% -----Conclusion so far (after people's comments)There is nothing like real sub‑package in Python as all package references goes to a global dictionnary only which means there's no local dictionary which implies there's is no way to manage local package reference.You have to either use full prefix or short prefix or alias. As in:Full prefix versionfrom package.subpackage.module import attribute1# An repeat it again an again# But after that you can simply:use_of (attribute1)Short prefix version (but repeated prefix)from package.subpackage import module# Short but then you have to do:use_of (module.attribute1)# and repeat the prefix at every use placeOr else a variation of the above.from package.subpackage import module as muse_of (m.attribute1)# `m` is a shorter prefix but you could as well# define a more meaningful name after the contextFactorized versionIf you don't mind about importing multiple entity all at once in a batch you can:from package.subpackage.module import attribute1 attribute2# and etc.Not in my first favorite taste (I prefer to have one import statement per imported entity) but may be the one I will personally favor.Update (2012-09-14):Finally appears to be OK in practice except with a comment about the layout. Instead of the above I used:from package.subpackage.module import (    attribute1     attribute2    attribute3    ...)  # and etc.","[<code>dir|+--test.py|+--package|+--__init__.py|+--subpackage|+--__init__.py|+--module.py</code><code>package/__init__.py</code><code>package/subpackage/__init__.py</code><code>module.py</code><code>#file`package/subpackage/module.py`attribute1=value1attribute2=value2attribute3=value3#andasmanymoreasyouwant...</code><code>test.py</code><code>#filetest.pyfrompackage.subpackage.moduleimport*printattribute1#OK</code><code>#filetest.pyimportpackage.subpackage.modulefrompackage.subpackageimportmodule#Alternativefrommoduleimportattribute1</code><code>#filetest.pyimportpackage.subpackage.modulefrompackage.subpackageimportmodule#Alternativeprintmodule#Surprisehere</code><code>&ltmodule'package.subpackage.module'from'...'</code><code>#filetest.pyv3frompackage.subpackage.moduleimportattribute1printattribute1#OK</code><code>import*</code><code>sys.path</code><code>*.pth</code><code>sys.path</code><code>package/subpackage/__init__.py</code><code>subpackage</code><code>printsubpackage</code><code>frompackage.subpackage.moduleimportattribute1#Anrepeatitagainanagain#Butafterthatyoucansimply:use_of(attribute1)</code><code>frompackage.subpackageimportmodule#Shortbutthenyouhavetodo:use_of(module.attribute1)#andrepeattheprefixateveryuseplace</code><code>frompackage.subpackageimportmoduleasmuse_of(m.attribute1)#`m`isashorterprefixbutyoucouldaswell#defineamoremeaningfulnameafterthecontext</code><code>frompackage.subpackage.moduleimportattribute1attribute2#andetc.</code><code>frompackage.subpackage.moduleimport(attribute1attribute2attribute3...)#andetc.</code>]"

I tried running the whole example with 'windows-1250' and got 'ëeaî?'. Windows-1250 uses single-character set so it worked for those characters it understands. However I still have no idea how to make 'utf-8' work here.UPD3: Oh I found out it is a known Python bug. I guess what happens is that Python copies the cmd encoding as 'cp65001 to sys.stdin.encoding and tries to apply it to all the input.
